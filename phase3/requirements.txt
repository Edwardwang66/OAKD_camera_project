# Phase 3 Requirements for Raspberry Pi 5
# Person Following with Obstacle Avoidance using OAKD Lite Camera
# Based on Phase 2, adds obstacle avoidance functionality

# Core dependencies
opencv-python>=4.8.0
numpy>=1.24.0
depthai>=2.23.0
blobconverter>=1.0.0  # Required for person detection and depth support
mediapipe>=0.10.0  # Fallback for person detection

# For VESC control (optional, install separately)
# pyserial>=3.5
# donkeycar (install separately: https://docs.donkeycar.com/)

# Note: For actual car control, you need:
# 1. DonkeyCar installed and configured on Raspberry Pi
# 2. VESC firmware updated and calibrated
# 3. Proper serial port permissions: sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Phase 3 shares modules with Phase 2 (oakd_camera, car_controller, person_follower)
# These modules are located in ../phase2/ directory
